<h1>Electronic Music Pages: PT-1984</h1>

<P>When I was a kid, I received a small keyboard for Christmas. It was the most exciting present ever (just edging out a Lego Technic tractor). I’m still making electronic music & thought it would be nice to capture those sounds, & a sense of digital wonder, by constructing this preset bank for Arturia Pigments 4 & Analog Lab V.</P>

<P>PT-1984 includes nine fully-scoped presets for an augmented lo-fi experience, including: Celesta, Clarinet, Drums, Flute, Harpsichord, Organ, Piano, Trumpet & Violin.</P>

<P>Each preset includes multiple modulation options via four macros & the modulation wheel. And each one is paired with a second, simple preset which plays the original sound with no additional processing.</P>

<P>There's also documentation included in the download which explains how the sounds were created. And I've created 'cover art' for the bank: you'll find installation instructions in the download.</P>

<P>Maybe it’s not quite the same as tearing the wrapping paper off a brightly coloured box, but it is free. So, load up Pigments or Analog Lab V, have fun, & share whatever wonders you create.</P>

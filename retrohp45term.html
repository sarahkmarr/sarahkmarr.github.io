<h1>Retrocomputing Pages: HP45TERM</h1>

<p><b>Hi! Sarah here, adding a note in July 2023. You probably don't want to use HP45TERM. It works perfectly well — and is your only option if you're using a Z80-MBC2 — but <a href="retrohp1973.html">HP1973</a> includes more calculators, provides much more information about them, and uses internal code which more closely duplicates the hardware implementation of the original calculators. Why not try that, instead?</b></p>

<p>Quick download link: <a href="hp45term.zip">HP45TERM</a></p>

<p>I love the HP-45 calculator. It's beautiful on the outside, but I wanted to show people that it's beautiful on the inside, too. So, as a coding and retrocomputing challenge I wrote a simulator.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>The simulator was designed for the <a href="retroz80mbc2.html">Z80-MBC2</a>, a computer with a Z80 processor running CP/M. (If you like retrocomputing, do try it.) But, after some tedious wrangling, I was able to write code which also compiled for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Raspberry Pi OS (32 bit).</p>

<p>I like the sense of retro-tech and (unfulfilled) futures which the terminal application provides: it's a hauntological calculator. It's also flexible: you can change what's shown on the display and, for slower machines (say, an 8MHz Z80), you can run in minimal mode, for speed.</p>

<p>Because I want hp45term to explain the genius of the HP-45's ROM code, I've kept my code as simple and clear as I could, & made sure that it includes copious & detailed comments throughout, explaining how the calculator processes the 2048 bytes of its ROM.</p>

<p>And because the HP-45's ROM is so beautifully crafted, I've also included a new version of the disassembled ROM, to show what it's doing in each byte. HP45TERM itself includes a "heat map" to show how each key press is processed throughout the bytes of ROM.</p>

<p>Download it <a href="hp45term.zip">here</a>. The zip file includes documentation, source code and compiled versions for all the platforms. I hope you enjoy it. There are help screens in the program, but if you're new to the HP-45 (or RPN) then start <a href="http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/pdf/HP-45%20Owner%27s%20Handbook.pdf">here</a>. Oh, and yes, it does implement the secret timer function.</p>
